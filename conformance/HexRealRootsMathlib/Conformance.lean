Companion conformance checks for `HexRealRootsMathlib`.

Oracle: none; checked against Mathlib root counts via the proven
correspondence theorems. `rootCount_eq_card_roots` (and `squareFreeRat_iff` feeding its
square-free hypothesis) is the bridge that ties the executable, computable
`Hex.rootCount` to the noncomputable Mathlib `(toPolyℝ p).roots.card`. There is
no external oracle profile: the two sides are pinned independently — the
executable side by `#guard` (native evaluation) and the Mathlib side by a
hand-derived root-multiset computation proven as a theorem — and the correspond-
ence theorem certifies they agree.
Mode: always for core.

Covered operations:
* `Hex.rootCount`, the executable real-root count, tied to the noncomputable
  Mathlib count `(toPolyℝ p).roots.card` by `rootCount_eq_card_roots`.

Covered properties:
* `rootCount p = (toPolyℝ p).roots.card`, the root-count correspondence,
  instantiated per fixture (executable side `#guard`ed, Mathlib side proven as a
  theorem from an independent factorisation).
* the full formal tie on `x - 5`: `Hex.rootCount = 1` derived through
  `rootCount_eq_card_roots` and `squareFreeRat_iff`, not read off evaluation.

Covered edge cases:
* degree-0 nonzero constant (`const7 = 7`), below the correspondence theorem's
  positive-degree hypothesis: no roots, executable count `0`.
* a polynomial with no real roots (`quadNone = x^2 + 1`): count `0`.
* a polynomial with several distinct real roots (`cubicTriple = x^3 - x`):
  count `3`.

Because Mathlib root counts are noncomputable, the checks are **theorems**, not
`#guard`s of the root multiset. For each committed fixture:

* `toPolyℝ_<fixture>` identifies the real cast of the executable polynomial with
  an explicit `Polynomial ℝ` (mechanical `coeff` comparison).
* `card_<fixture>` computes `(toPolyℝ <fixture>).roots.card` from that explicit
  polynomial by an independent Mathlib factorisation (the hand-derived count).
* `#guard Hex.rootCount <fixture> = N` confirms the executable engine computes
  the same `N` at runtime.

This module certifies that the **theorem layer** connects — that the
correspondence theorems instantiate and transport concrete counts — rather than
re-running the executable oracle (which is `HexRealRoots.Conformance`'s job).
The `x − 5` fixture carries the full formal tie: `rootCount_x_sub_5` derives
`Hex.rootCount = 1` from `rootCount_eq_card_roots` and the independent
`card_linear`, so the executable value (also `#guard`ed) is pinned by the
theorem, not just by evaluation. The higher-degree fixtures certify each side
independently against the same hand-derived count; their full ties would need a
square-free proof of each rational cast, which the linear demonstrator already
exhibits end to end.

`rootCount_eq_card_roots` needs a `SquareFreeRat` witness; for `x − 5` it comes
from `squareFreeRat_iff` and the irreducibility of the linear rational cast.
Chained with `card_linear`, the correspondence theorem pins the executable
`Hex.rootCount` to `1` as a theorem — the same value the `#guard` above
evaluates. -/

This exercises the caller-facing API added for isolating the real roots of a
concrete polynomial, so the "one certified interval, `simp`" path stays green:

* the Sturm squarefree certificate `squareFreeRat_of_hasSquarefreeSturmChain`,
  discharged by `by decide` on the executable chain (no rational gcd);
* the coefficient-sum `eval_toPolyℝ` bridge, turning `IsRoot` into `x⁴ − 2 = 0`;
* the conversion of integral dyadic endpoints to real numbers;
* the `Hex`-namespace dot-notation alias `RealRootIsolation.exists_unique_root`.

The interval `(1, 2]` isolates `+2^{1/4}`.  High-precision refinement belongs
to the executable real-roots benchmarks; this theorem checks the
mathematician-facing correspondence without making compilation depend on the
size of dyadic numerators. -/
