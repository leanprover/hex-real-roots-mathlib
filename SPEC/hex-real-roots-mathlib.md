# hex-real-roots-mathlib (depends on hex-real-roots + hex-poly-z-mathlib + Mathlib)

Mathlib companion for [hex-real-roots](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-real-roots). Proves
**soundness** of the certified isolations (a `RealRootIsolation`
witness implies a unique real root in its half-open interval, and a
`RealRootIsolations` value captures every real root exactly once) and
**completeness** of the driver (`isolate? p ≠ none` for squarefree
`p`, through the Sturm engine). One theorem is deferred: that the
Descartes engine alone never falls back. It is stated here, its
prerequisite is named, and nothing else depends on it.

**Scope.** The theorem everything rests on is **Sturm's theorem**,
which Mathlib does not have (it is on the 1000+-theorems target
list). The formalisation is well-trodden elsewhere: Isabelle has
Eberl's Sturm entry and Li's Sturm-Tarski entry in the AFP, and
Coq/MathComp has the Cohen-Mahboubi real-closed-field development.
The proof is elementary real analysis over `ℝ[X]`: local sign
behaviour of the chain at finitely many points, with no complex
analysis anywhere in the load-bearing path. The development is
organised as a self-contained slice over `Polynomial ℝ` with no
`HexRealRoots` dependence, so it can be contributed to Mathlib once
exercised here.

Mathlib's Descartes material
(`Mathlib.Algebra.Polynomial.RuleOfSigns`) is deliberately **not**
cited: the Descartes engine is an uncertified search wrapped in Sturm
certificates, so no Descartes soundness statement is an obligation of
this library.

## Sturm development (self-contained, upstreamable)

Stated for `Polynomial ℝ`, with no reference to Hex types.

```lean
/-- A generalised Sturm chain for `p`: the sign axioms that the
    counting argument actually uses, as explicit fields.

    - the chain is nonempty and its head is `p`;
    - at every real root `r` of `p`, the second element is nonzero,
      and `p * chain[1]` is negative on a punctured left
      neighbourhood of `r` and positive on a punctured right
      neighbourhood;
    - consecutive elements have no common real zero;
    - whenever an interior element vanishes at a point, its two
      neighbours are nonzero there and have opposite signs;
    - the last element is nonzero and has no real zero. -/
structure IsSturmChain (p : Polynomial ℝ) (chain : List (Polynomial ℝ)) : Prop

/-- Zero-skipping sign variations of the chain at a point. -/
def sturmVar (chain : List (Polynomial ℝ)) (x : ℝ) : ℕ
```

### Theorem chain

1. `sturmVar` is locally constant on any interval containing no zero
   of any chain element (continuity plus sign persistence).
2. Crossing a zero of an interior chain element does not change
   `sturmVar`: the flanking elements have opposite signs there, so
   the local sign pattern `(±, 0, ∓)` contributes one variation
   before, at, and after the crossing.
3. Crossing a simple zero `r` of `p` decreases `sturmVar` by exactly
   one, and with the zero-skipping convention the decrease registers
   exactly at `r`: the variation between the first two elements is
   present for `x < r`, already absent at `x = r`.
4. **Sturm's theorem, half-open form.** For `p ≠ 0` squarefree and a
   generalised Sturm chain of `p`:
   `sturmVar chain a − sturmVar chain b` equals the number of roots
   of `p` in `(a, b]`, for any `a < b`.
5. **Line form.** With variations at `±∞` defined through leading
   coefficients and degree parities: the total number of real roots
   of `p` equals `sturmVar₋∞ − sturmVar₊∞`.

Steps 1-3 are the standard local lemmas; the theorem is a telescoping
sum over the finitely many zeros of the chain elements in `(a, b]`.
The half-open convention in step 3 is the one design-sensitive point,
and it is what makes the executable `sturmCount` match hex-real-roots'
half-open intervals with no endpoint hypotheses.

## Chain correspondence

Connects the executable chain to the abstract development.

```lean
/-- Each element of `Hex.sturmChain p` is a positive rational
    multiple of the corresponding element of the signed remainder
    sequence of `(p, p')` over `ℝ`, and the mapped chain satisfies
    `IsSturmChain`. Induction on the `spem` identity
    `spem f g = c · (f mod g)` with `c > 0`. -/
theorem sturmChain_isSturmChain (p : ZPoly) (hp : SquareFreeRat p) :
    IsSturmChain (toPolyℝ p) ((Hex.sturmChain p).toList.map toPolyℝ)

/-- Positive scaling of chain elements does not change sign
    variations, so the executable counts compute the abstract ones. -/
theorem sturmVarAt_eq (p : ZPoly) (x : Dyadic) : …

/-- `SquareFreeRat p ↔ Squarefree (toPolyℚ p)` (hex-poly-z-mathlib's
    executable gcd correspondence), and squarefreeness transfers to
    `ℝ`. -/
theorem squareFreeRat_iff : …

/-- A terminal-constant Sturm chain forces `SquareFreeRat` — the reverse
    of the terminal-unit step in `sturmChain_isSturmChain`, walked back to
    coprime seeds. Lets a concrete `SquareFreeRat p` be discharged by
    `by decide` on the chain. -/
theorem squareFreeRat_of_hasSquarefreeSturmChain
    (p : ZPoly) (h : hasSquarefreeSturmChain p = true) : SquareFreeRat p
```

`toPolyℝ` abbreviates the `hex-poly-z-mathlib` cast composed with
`Polynomial.map (Int.castRingHom ℝ)`. Its coefficient/coefficient-sum
bridges (`coeff_toPolyℝ` / `coeff_toPolyℚ`, `eval_toPolyℝ` /
`eval_toPolyℚ`) rewrite a root goal on a literal `ofCoeffs` to an explicit
polynomial equation, and `toReal_ofInt_shiftRight` normalizes `n / 2ⁱ`
dyadic endpoints. `evalSign_zero_iff` packages exact dyadic Horner evaluation
as the reusable equivalence between zero sign and a real root at the endpoint.

### Literal-chain replay API

Consumers such as [hex-rcf](hex-rcf.md) certify a supplied chain by
multiplication identities without identifying it with the executable
`sturmChain`. The companion therefore exposes a second bridge from
literal integer-polynomial chains to the same abstract theorem.

The reusable proof is an induction over an abstract list of at least two entries
`[f, s₁, ..., sₙ]` with these hypotheses:

- every entry is nonzero and `sₙ` is a nonzero constant;
- `derivative f = scale δ s₁` for a positive integer `δ`;
- every consecutive triple satisfies
  `scale α sᵢ = q * sᵢ₊₁ - scale β sᵢ₊₂` for positive integers
  `α`, `β` and a supplied `q`.

It concludes that the cast list is an `IsSturmChain (toPolyℝ f)` and
that `toPolyℝ f` is squarefree. Degree descent is useful for bounding and
validating a compiled replay certificate, but is not an axiom of
`IsSturmChain` and is therefore not a hypothesis of this proof. The induction
is independent of `chainList` and serves RCF's Boolean literal-chain checker;
the older executable correspondence remains a separate proof for the chain it
constructs. Both use the public supporting lemmas for reverse coprimality,
derivative flanks, and exclusion of a common zero.

The finite-point bridge `sturmVarAt_eq` and the infinity bridges
`sturmVarNegInf_eq` / `sturmVarPosInf_eq` are public for an arbitrary
literal `Array ZPoly`. Together with `Sturm.sturm_half_open` and
`Sturm.sturm_line`, they turn literal executable variation reads into
root counts without calling `sturmCount` or `rootCount`. The
`ZReplay.count_eq_card_roots` and `ZReplay.total_eq_card_roots` corollaries
perform the list-to-array alignment and compose replay, squarefreeness, and
counting in the form consumed by a checker.

The same layer supplies generalized isolation semantics parameterized
by those literal counts: count-one gives a unique root in `(lower,
upper]`, while an ordered complete array captures every root exactly
once. These statements consume `Squarefree (toPolyℝ f)` and `f ≠ 0`,
not the executable `SquareFreeRat f` predicate, and do not reuse the
current `RealRootIsolation` fields that are definitionally tied to
`sturmCount`. The existing executable isolation theorem remains separate for
API compatibility: the generic statement intentionally mirrors its finite
cardinality argument rather than coupling the literal layer back to the
executable structures it is meant to abstract over.

### Consequences for the executable counts

```lean
theorem sturmCount_eq_card_roots (p : ZPoly) (hp : SquareFreeRat p)
    (I : DyadicInterval) :
    Hex.sturmCount p I =
      ((toPolyℝ p).roots.filter (fun r => I.lower < r ∧ r ≤ I.upper)).card

theorem rootCount_eq_card_roots (p : ZPoly) (hp : SquareFreeRat p) :
    Hex.rootCount p = (toPolyℝ p).roots.card
```

## Isolation semantics

Everything below consumes only the decidable fields of the output
structures plus `SquareFreeRat p` (and, for `isolates`, `p ≠ 0`, since
`SquareFreeRat 0` is vacuous), so it holds for any `RealRootIsolations p`
value, no matter which engine produced it.

```lean
/-- The witness means what it says: exactly one real root in the
    half-open interval. -/
theorem RealRootIsolation.exists_unique_root
    (hp : SquareFreeRat p) (iso : RealRootIsolation p) :
    ∃! r : ℝ, (toPolyℝ p).IsRoot r ∧
      (iso.interval.lower : ℝ) < r ∧ r ≤ (iso.interval.upper : ℝ)

/-- A complete run captures every real root exactly once. -/
theorem RealRootIsolations.isolates
    (hp0 : p ≠ 0) (hp : SquareFreeRat p) (out : RealRootIsolations p) :
    ∀ r : ℝ, (toPolyℝ p).IsRoot r →
      ∃! iso ∈ out.isolations.toList,
        (iso.interval.lower : ℝ) < r ∧ r ≤ (iso.interval.upper : ℝ)
```

The second follows from the first plus `ordered` (disjointness) and
`complete` (counting): the isolations hold `rootCount p` distinct
roots among them, and that is all the roots there are. Both are also
exported in the `Hex` namespace, so dot notation resolves on the
executable structures (`iso.exists_unique_root`).

## The `isolate_roots` term elaborator

A user-facing front-end that automates the pattern of the worked
`x⁴ − 2` example: run the executable isolator at elaboration time and
package the certified result as one term the caller can `obtain`,
`have`, or pass to `grind`.

```lean
-- natural intervals (whatever the isolator's separation produced)
isolate_roots p
-- every interval refined to width at most x
isolate_roots (width := x) p
```

`p` is either a closed `Hex.ZPoly` term or a closed `Polynomial ℤ/ℚ/ℝ`
expression over `X`, `C`, numerals, `+`, `-`, `*`, `^` whose
coefficients are integers (non-integer coefficients are rejected with
a clear message). The width `x` is any closed positive rational
literal expression (`1/1000`, `2^(-20)`, `10^(-2)`); it converts to
the bit target `k = max 0 ⌈log₂ x⁻¹⌉` in exact integer arithmetic
(widths above `1` never coarsen the natural intervals) and is an
operational promise about the emitted intervals, not a field of the
result. The syntax uses an `atomic` lookahead on `"(" "width" ":="`
so a parenthesised polynomial argument parses as the polynomial.

When an expected type `Hex.IsolatedRealRoots (P : Polynomial R) n` is
available at the call site, the coefficient ring `R` is used as the
elaboration hint for the argument, so `isolate_roots (X ^ 4 - 2)` (no
type ascription on the argument) elaborates as a `Polynomial ℝ` under
`… : IsolatedRealRoots (X ^ 4 - 2 : Polynomial ℝ) 2`. The hint is a
fallback: the argument is first elaborated with no expected type (a
`ZPoly` argument, or an already-ascribed polynomial, resolves this way
and is unaffected), and the ring hint is applied only when that leaves
the argument's type ambiguous.

The result type, uniform over the input rings through `aeval`:

```lean
structure Hex.IsolatedRealRoots {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [Algebra R ℝ]
    (P : Polynomial R) (n : ℕ) where
  intervals   : Vector (ℚ × ℚ) n
  unique_root : ∀ i : Fin n, ∃! x : ℝ,
      Polynomial.aeval x P = 0 ∧ (intervals[i].1 : ℝ) < x ∧ x ≤ intervals[i].2
  covers      : ∀ x : ℝ, Polynomial.aeval x P = 0 →
      ∃ i : Fin n, (intervals[i].1 : ℝ) < x ∧ x ≤ intervals[i].2
  ordered     : ∀ i j : Fin n, i < j → intervals[i].2 ≤ intervals[j].1
```

`ordered` makes the enumeration honest: without it, duplicate
intervals could satisfy the other two fields and `n` would not
determine the root count; with it the intervals are pairwise
disjoint and sorted, so `n` is exactly the number of distinct real
roots (a derived lemma, not a field). Intervals are half-open
`(lo, hi]` with exact rational endpoints (the isolator's dyadics). A `ZPoly` input is stated over `toPolynomial p :
Polynomial ℤ`. The elaborator is fat-API/thin-meta: all proof content
lives in library constructors, and the emitted term only instantiates
them with literals and `decide`-style certificates.

- `IsolatedRealRoots.of` : from `p ≠ 0` (stated as a size check, see
  below), `SquareFreeRat p`, and a `RealRootIsolations p` value, via
  `exists_unique_root` + `isolates` and the cast lemmas.
- `IsolatedRealRoots.congrRoots` : transport along
  `∀ x : ℝ, aeval x P = 0 ↔ aeval x Q = 0`, heterogeneous in the
  coefficient rings (`P : Polynomial R`, `Q : Polynomial S`) since it
  is used twice with different rings: once for the squarefree-core
  step and once to restate over the user's polynomial (the latter
  hypothesis closed by a bridge tactic over
  `aeval`-of-`toPolynomial` unfolding, coefficient lookups, and
  `norm_num` — a pointwise evaluation bridge, not a `Polynomial`
  identity).
- `IsolatedRealRoots.constant` : the `n = 0` result for nonzero
  constants, which never enter the isolator (the squarefree Sturm
  certificate is `false` on constants by design).
- The **replay constructor**: the production certificate shape (see
  below).

**Squarefreeness is invisible to the user.** If
`hasSquarefreeSturmChain p` fails, the elaborator runs on
`squareFreeCore p` and transports along

```lean
theorem aevalIff_squareFreeCore (hp0 : p ≠ 0) (x : ℝ) :
    Polynomial.aeval x (toPolynomial (ZPoly.squareFreeCore p)) = 0 ↔
    Polynomial.aeval x (toPolynomial p) = 0
```

(the roots of a nonzero polynomial and of its squarefree core agree
as sets; proven through the `primitiveSquareFreeDecomposition`
bridge and a root-multiplicity argument, and shared with the `rcf`
tactic's step 3).

The elaborator's own transport does not identify the reified core
with `squareFreeCore p` in the kernel — that identification would
need to reduce `squareFreeCore`'s rational-arithmetic helpers, which
are deliberately outside the replay closure. It instead emits a
radical certificate: reified cofactors `a`, `b`, a scalar `t`, and an
exponent `k` with the two literal `ring` identities
`orig = core * a` and `t · core^(k+1) = a * b`, from which
`aevalIff_radical` derives the shared real root set. Squarefreeness
stays invisible either way; `aevalIff_squareFreeCore` remains the
library-level statement (and the `rcf` dependency).

**Kernel replay.** Following the `factor_poly` / `irreducibility` pattern (and
hex-rcf §Kernel replay), the elaborator never asks the kernel to
re-run the search. Measured on the Stage-1 prototype, the naive
per-field `decide` shape (each `count_one`/`complete` certificate
rebuilding the Sturm chain) grows superlinearly — heartbeats
33k/103k/326k at Wilkinson degrees 6/8/10 — while the replay shape
(reify the Sturm chain once as an `Array ZPoly` literal, then check
per-endpoint sign variations against it) amortises to 29k/66k/138k,
2.4× cheaper at degree 10 and scaling. The prototype's replay
numbers are surrogate measurements: its chain-identification lemmas
were assumed, so the cost of the `SturmChainCert` validity check
itself is not yet measured and is re-measured when the production
constructor lands. The elaborator emits the replay shape. Two constraints shape its soundness lemma:

- chain validity is verified by a decidable executable certificate
  predicate `SturmChainCert p chain` over coefficient-level checks
  (distinct from the companion's existing semantic `IsSturmChain`
  over `Polynomial ℝ`, which is stated through `primitivePart p` and
  is not decidable), NOT by deciding `chain = sturmChain p` (a
  nonempty `Array ZPoly` equality, which does not kernel-reduce
  under the module system: the core `Array.instDecidableEqImpl`
  issue). Its soundness bridge to the certified counts goes through
  the executable chain's `primitivePart` head, exactly as the
  existing chain correspondence does. `SturmChainCert p chain` also
  carries a `chain.size ≤ p.size` fuel-bound conjunct — every genuine
  Sturm chain satisfies it, since chain degrees strictly decrease —
  which the soundness proof (`cert_imp_eq`) needs to bound the
  `sturmChainAux` fuel when reconstructing `sturmChain p` from the
  certified tail; the constructor discharges it by the same
  per-certificate `decide`;
- nonzeroness is stated as a size check (`p.size ≠ 0` via a Bool
  test plus `ne_zero_of_size_ne_zero`), avoiding structural
  `DensePoly` equality for the same reason.

The executable closure the kernel replays — thirteen definitions:
`sturmChain`, `sturmChainAux`, `spem`, `spemAux`, `spemStep`,
`signVar`, `sturmVarAt`, `sturmVarNegInf`, `sturmVarPosInf`,
`sturmCount`, `rootCount`, `ZPoly.evalDyadic`, `dyadicSign` — is
`@[expose]`d in hex-real-roots for this purpose, with the three
private helpers (`spemStep`, `spemAux`, `sturmChainAux`)
de-privatized (an exposed public definition may not reference a
`private` one); see the hex-real-roots SPEC. `Dyadic.toReal`'s unfolding is provided by a
cast lemma rather than cross-module defeq.

**Interval literals.** The emitted term re-bases `intervals` on
pretty rational literals (`m`, or `m / 2^k` in lowest terms) via
`IsolatedRealRoots.ofCertPretty`, which wraps the replay constructor
in `withIntervals`: any interval vector whose endpoints agree with
the isolator's **as reals** carries the same three theorems. The
endpoint identities are stated against the literal `iso` argument
itself (`Dyadic.toReal` of each reified dyadic — a shape user
modules check without reducing any of this library's definitions)
and discharged through the `toReal` cast lemmas, so no `Rat`
normalization (and hence no `Nat.gcd`) comes near the kernel. With
`intervals` definitionally a `#v[…]` literal, user-side endpoint
extraction is a definitional step:
`rw [show H.intervals = #v[…] from rfl]`. The wrappers this step
unfolds (`withIntervals`, `ofCertPretty`, `congrRoots`) are
`@[expose]`d so the reduction works from module-system files; it
never reaches `ofCert` itself. Their `intervals` projections also
carry `@[simp]` lemmas (`ofCertPretty_intervals`,
`withIntervals_intervals`, `congrRoots_intervals`), so `simp`,
`simpa`, and `grind` compute an isolation's endpoints to their
literals without naming the constructors: a `unique_root i`
projection closes a concrete-endpoint theorem with a single
`simpa [H]`. The whole `IsolatedRealRoots` API (`of`, `ofCert`,
`withIntervals`, `ofCertPretty`, `congrRoots`, `constant`) lives in
the `Hex.IsolatedRealRoots` namespace alongside the structure, so
dot notation reaches every constructor and lemma.

**Errors** are user-grade and distinguish: the zero polynomial
("every real number is a root"), non-integer coefficients,
unsupported polynomial syntax, non-closed input (free variables or
metavariables, in the polynomial or the width), non-positive or
non-closed width, backend failure, and internal certificate mismatch
(a bug, reported as such).

**Practical limits** (Stage-1 measurements, single-threaded
elaboration): degree ≤ 10 at natural widths, and degree ≤ 6 refined
to `2^(-20)`, cost seconds (deeper refined-width combinations are
unmeasured); per-field certificates remain acceptable only below
degree ~6. The
elaborator caps refinement with a diagnostic for pathological widths.

**Phase-4 proof evidence.** `isolate_roots` is an elaboration/proof surface,
not a LeanBench executable. Build-only modules below
`bench/HexRealRootsMathlib/ProofProbe/` measure natural-width Wilkinson
products at degrees 6, 8, and 10 and width-`2^(-20)` products at degrees 2, 4,
and 6. Each case is adjacent to the same import-only baseline, and degree 6
also has a direct natural-to-refined pair. Baseline and natural-degree-10
same-module controls are first in manifest `config.order`; execution order
rotates by round. The external runner uses six balanced rounds, exact
generated-artifact invalidation, ordinary kernel checking, exact axiom
validation, and complete source provenance.
`HexRealRootsMathlibReplayProbe` supplies the reduced CI coverage;
`HexRealRootsMathlibReplayProbeScientific` owns the larger release arms and
remains outside routine CI.

On the named shared release machine a canonical invocation is:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench/real_roots_mathlib_sweep.py --samples 6 \
  --timeout 180 --warm-timeout 600 \
  --shared-host --expected-host chungus2 --cpu 22
```

The release run preregisters its selected logical CPU and aggregate
interference ratio on the command line; the artifact and headline report record
those exact values. They govern that run rather than the illustrative CPU
number above.

The runner enforces the designated-shared-host contract in
`SPEC/benchmarking.md`, including bounded retries of complete rejected pairs
after a bounded quiet-core preflight and a single aggregate pinned-core/SMT
interference ceiling; `--allow-busy` remains diagnostic-only. Executable
isolation arithmetic belongs to the existing Mathlib-free `HexRealRoots`
benchmark. The bridge declarations have no separable compiled runtime kernel.
For the proof-emitting elaborator there is
`no-comparable-surface-in-named-comparator`: no external tool emits and
kernel-checks the same Lean proof term.

A Mathlib-free variant (same meta core, emitting a
`RealRootIsolations` value whose conclusions are the executable
Sturm certificates) is a possible follow-up for consumers who cannot
import Mathlib; the ℝ-valued statements above necessarily live here.

## Bounds and depths

```lean
theorem rootBound_bounds_roots (p : ZPoly) :
    ∀ r : ℝ, (toPolyℝ p).IsRoot r → |r| < (Hex.rootBound p : ℝ)
  -- via Polynomial.IsRoot.norm_lt_cauchyBound and the power-of-two
  -- rounding.

theorem sepPrec_separates (p : ZPoly) (hp : SquareFreeRat p) :
    ∀ z₁ z₂ : ℂ, (toPolyℂ p).IsRoot z₁ → (toPolyℂ p).IsRoot z₂ →
      z₁ ≠ z₂ → (2 : ℝ)^(−(Hex.sepPrec p : ℤ)) < ‖z₁ − z₂‖ / 4
  -- Pairwise, hence vacuous for degree ≤ 1, where no consumer needs
  -- it. Mahler's bound with |disc p| ≥ 1 and Landau's inequality.
  -- toPolyℂ is the ℂ-cast analogue of toPolyℝ.
```

The separation development is the same closed form as
hex-roots-mathlib's (§"Discriminant / separation development" there),
and like the Sturm slice it has no dependence on the executable
library. When both root libraries are active the proof should be
hosted once, in hex-poly-z-mathlib (a dependency of both companions),
and cited from each. Neither companion should carry a private copy.

## Driver completeness

```lean
/-- The Sturm engine succeeds on squarefree input: at
    `isolationDepth p` every interval is narrower than `sep(p)/4`,
    hence narrower than any gap between real roots, hence has Sturm
    count 0 or 1, so the worklist drains and the totals match. -/
theorem isolateSturm?_isSome (p : ZPoly) (hp : SquareFreeRat p) :
    (Hex.isolateSturm? p).isSome

theorem isolate?_isSome (p : ZPoly) (hp : SquareFreeRat p) :
    (Hex.isolate? p).isSome
```

Note this argument needs only the real-pair instances of
`sepPrec_separates` (distinct real roots are at least
`4 · 2^{−sepPrec p}` apart). Exact
counts are what make the real-gap quantity sufficient. The Descartes
engine's variation counts are also disturbed by nearby non-real
roots, which is why its termination statement (deferred, below) needs
the two-circle theorem rather than this argument.

## Refinement and root identity

```lean
theorem refine1_isolates_same (hp : SquareFreeRat p)
    (iso : RealRootIsolation p) :
    -- the unique roots of `iso` and `iso.refine1` coincide, and the
    -- width strictly halves (the fallback branch is unreachable).
    …

/-- `Overlaps` on `RefinedRealIsolation` is an equivalence relation
    whose classes are exactly the real roots. -/
theorem overlaps_iff_same_root (hp : SquareFreeRat p)
    (i₁ i₂ : RefinedRealIsolation p) :
    Hex.Overlaps i₁ i₂ ↔ theRoot i₁ = theRoot i₂

def SimpleRealRoot.toReal (hp : SquareFreeRat p) :
    SimpleRealRoot p → ℝ
  -- lifts `theRoot` through the quotient; well-defined by
  -- `overlaps_iff_same_root`.

theorem SimpleRealRoot.toReal_isRoot … : (toPolyℝ p).IsRoot (s.toReal hp)
theorem SimpleRealRoot.toReal_injective … : Function.Injective (toReal hp)
theorem sameRoot_iff (hp) (i₁ i₂) :
    RefinedRealIsolation.sameRoot i₁ i₂ = true ↔
      SimpleRealRoot.mk i₁ = SimpleRealRoot.mk i₂
```

`theRoot` is the unique root delivered by
`RealRootIsolation.exists_unique_root`.

## Descartes engine termination (the two-circle theorem)

```lean
theorem isolateDescartes?_isSome (p : ZPoly) (hp0 : p ≠ 0)
    (hp : SquareFreeRat p) : (Hex.isolateDescartes? p).isSome
```

Proven in `TwoCircle.lean`; with it the companion is fully
`sorry`-free. The Descartes engine alone returns `some` on every
nonzero square-free input, so the runtime never falls back to the
Sturm engine.

Prerequisite: the **Obreshkoff two-circle theorem**, in its correct
*λ-graded* form (Obreschkoff 1963; Krandick-Mehlhorn 2006,
Eigenwillig 2008): if all but `λ` complex roots of a real polynomial
lie in the closed sector of half-angle `π/(λ+2)` about the negative real
axis (equivalently, at most `λ` roots lie outside), then the
coefficient sequence has at most `λ` sign variations. The naive count
bound "variation count ≤ number of roots in the two-circle region" is
**false** — `(X²+X+1)·(X²−(3/2)X+1)` has four sign variations while
only two of its roots lie outside the sector (the counterexample is
recorded in `TwoCircleSector.lean`). We use only the two lowest graded
cases, `λ ∈ {0, 1}`: `Polynomial.signVariations_le_one_of_sector`
(`TwoCircleSector.lean`, the `λ = 1` bound via Hoggar log-concavity)
and its `λ = 0` corollary.

Route (`TwoCircle.lean`): at each node the Descartes count `V` equals
`signVariations` of the Möbius transform; the Descartes parity exports
(`DescartesParity.lean`) pin the open-interval root count exactly when
`V ∈ {0, 1}`, and the exact endpoint test settles `p(b) = 0`, so the
half-open Sturm count is computed exactly and every candidate certifies
(count `1`) and every discard emits `#[]` (count `0`). At the depth
budget the bisecting rows are refuted: `V = 1 ∧ p(b) = 0` forces a
Sturm count of `2` against `sturmCount_le_one`, and `V ≥ 2` triggers
the sector bound (`≥ 2` transform-roots outside the sector correspond
via `roots_mobiusPoly`/`not_inTwoCircle_iff_mem_sector` to two distinct
`p`-roots in the two-circle region, closer than the Mahler separation
`sepPrec_separates'` allows). The worklist therefore drains at
`isolationDepth p`.

Status and boundaries:

- The two-circle theorem is now formalised here (the sector core
  `signVariations_le_one_of_sector`, the region geometry
  `TwoCircleRegion.lean`, and the Descartes parity). The classical
  proof (Obreschkoff 1963; Krandick-Mehlhorn 2006, Eigenwillig 2008)
  runs by induction on multiplying in linear and conjugate-quadratic
  factors, with sector inequalities on coefficient sequences.
- **Nothing else waited for it.** `isolate?_isSome`, all soundness
  theorems, and hex-rcf's decision procedure were complete without it;
  its value is to retire the Sturm fallback path from the trusted
  runtime story. The executable conformance stand-ins for this
  theorem (`isolateDescartes?` succeeds and agrees with `isolate?` per
  fixture) are retired in the same change now that the theorem carries
  the claim.
- Like the Sturm slice, the sector/region/parity development is stated
  against `Polynomial ℝ`/`ℂ` with no `HexRealRoots` dependence, ready
  as a Mathlib contribution in its own right.
